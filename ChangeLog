 0.1   First try.  Only does sign test and associated confidence interval.

 0.2   Now does Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (two sample) test and associate c. i.

 0.3   Finally!!!  Now does Wilcoxon (one sample) test and associate c. i.

 0.3-1   Removed test under WinDoze that makes it segfault under WinDoze.
