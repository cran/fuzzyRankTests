 0.1   First try.  Only does sign test and associated confidence interval.

 0.2   Now does Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (two sample) test and associate c. i.

 0.3   Finally!!!  Now does Wilcoxon (one sample) test and associate c. i.

 0.3-1   Removed test under WinDoze that makes it segfault under WinDoze.

 0.3-2   CHAR macro in Rinternals.h now returns const char * (or gcc now
         warns about).  Anyway need to make corresponding changes in my code.

         Also wording of blather from various bits of R had changed so
         updated .Rout.save in tests directory accordingly

         Also to typos had been corrected in inst/doc/design.tex but
         were not in the the previous version.
